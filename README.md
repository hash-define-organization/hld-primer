These are notes which will give you a good start at understanding high level system design. The first section of the notes discuss the main concepts that you should know about before designing a scalable system. The second section focuses on designing them.

## Prerequisites
You should have a basic understanding of concepts such as APIs, client-server models, what requests are and a little bit of experience with backend development. If you are not aware of basic concepts in backend development like APIs, servers, databases, you will have a hard time reading these notes, so I would recommend you to take a look at other resources. In some places, I've also assumed that you have a basic understanding of concepts related to RDBMS (If you're a computer science undergrad, you will learn that in your course).

## How to Read The Notes
The notes have been deployed here: https://hash-define-organization.github.io/hld-primer/  
If for some reason you don't like the interface, you can open [this file](./index.org) and read them directly on GitHub.

## Contributing
You're most welcome to make any kind of contributions that you want, be it fixing grammatical errors, improving a section, or adding images. You're also free to add missing topics that you feel should have been in these notes, but make sure to keep the language simple.
