# High Level Design Primer
These are notes which will give you a good start at understanding high level system design. The first section of the notes discuss the main concepts that you should know about before designing a scalable system. There may be a few errors here and there, but you will get a good idea about all things you should know about high level design.

## Prerequisites
You should have a basic understanding of concepts such as APIs, client-server models, what requests are and a little bit of experience with backend development. If you are not aware of basic concepts in backend development like APIs, servers, databases, you will have a hard time reading these notes, so I would recommend you to take a look at other resources. In some places, I've also assumed that you have a basic understanding of concepts related to RDBMS (If you're a computer science undergrad, you will learn that in your course).
